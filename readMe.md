## Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Javascript.

<hr/>

**This repository contains some important data-structures and algorithms. They are all implemented in Javascript.**

<hr/>

- **Why am i doing this?**
  I wish to further improve my problem-solving skills and my knowledge of the Javascript language.
  There is no standard library in Javascript that has all the commonly used data structures. This seems like an opportunity in disguise to me. I can learn these data structures, build them myself, and use them in solving problems in Javascript.
  <br>
- **What data-structures are available so far?**

  > - Singly Linked list
  > - Doubly Linked list
  > - Queue
  > - Stack
  > - Binary-search tree
  > - Priority queue (min heap)
  > - Priority queue (max heap)

- **What have I used these data structures for?**
  I have used these DS'es in implementing algorithms that solved problems related to:

  > - Breadth-first search in binary trees
  > - Depth-first search in binary trees
  > - Backtracking
  > - Sliding window technique
  > - Two-Pointers technique
  > - Prefix/Suffix Sum technique
  > - Binary search
  > - Greedy technique
  > - Monotonic stacks
  > - Fast and Slow pointers in a linked list

- **What exactly is the end goal here?**
  I will build every data structure that is needed to solve the problems present in Grind75, Sean Prashad 189, and Neetcode 150 lists. I will also add comments on how to use the interface, but currently it's for my own usage and i already know how to use each data structure.

- **A word of caution**
  The implementations of various data structures and algorithms in this repo may contain critical errors. These data structures have been used in solutions that pass Leetcode's test cases, but even that does not guarantee that they are ready to be used in production.
  <br>
- **How to I go about exploring the repository?**
  The data-structures are present in "/data structures" directory. The algorithms and their application in solving problems are present in a separate directory - "/algorithms".
  Each algorithm has its standard definition at the top. The problems associated with that algorithm follows the definition along with their corresponding Leetcode identifier. Most solutions are tested against all the edge-cases that Leetcode provides. Some solutions give TLE in Javascript but pass the tests in other faster languages. These are marked as such, but they are very few and far in between. This has absolutely no bearing on the application of the algorithm itself. DSA is supposed to be language agnostic anyway.

- **What does the presence of a asterisk symbol signify?**
The asterisk marked question are for my own usage. Some questions are tricky and a simple implementation of a particular algorithm does not lead to a solution that leetcode accepts. I have marked these question with an asterisk
